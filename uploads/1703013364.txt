The high quality of education will always be my main reason as 
to why I want to study abroad. 
While there is no shortage of premier universities in my country, 
the undeniable truth is that they pale in comparison to their 
counterparts in places such as europe. 
International universities have access to resources which made their 
brand of education so renowned in the first place, such as facilities,
 industry connections and of course, the funding.
In short, I simply want to learn from the best. 
Studying abroad in a prestigious university is not only a once in a 
lifetime opportunity, but it also ensures a brighter future for me
and my career.
Your study abroad location acts as a new testing ground for you to
 gauge people’s reactions to what you say and do, and seek to 
optimize the respective outcomes under your host country’s 
parameters. Local social etiquette may well vary from what you are
 used to which will enrich your communication efforts with an added 
note of sensitivity and diplomacy.
